At the current rate unemployment would actually be increasing if we take into account the number of people \"left behind\" by the government\\'s calculation.   Read more from The Associated Press:  The drop in the unemployment rate in August to a 4_-year low was hardly cause for celebration. The rate fell because more people stopped looking for work.  More than 300,000 people stopped working or looking for a job. Their exodus shrank the so-called labor force participation rate  the percentage of adult Americans with a job or seeking one  to 63.2 percent. It\\'s the lowest participation rate since August 1978.  Once people without a job stop looking for one, the government no longer counts them as unemployed. That\\'s why the unemployment rate dropped to 7.3 percent in August from 7.4 percent in July even though 115,000 fewer people said they had jobs.  If those who left the labor force last month had still been looking for work, the unemployment rate would have risen to 7.5 percent in August.

This legislation is necessary to protect volunteer firefighters from unintended consequences of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The bill has more than 80 cosponsors, including members of both parties.  An unexpected and previously undetected problem with the law represents special and urgent circumstances.  This really took me by surprise  the fact that the ACA could force volunteer fire companies to provide health insurance to their volunteers or pay a fine.  That would burden them with unbearable costs and possibly cause them to reduce the number of volunteers they have or shut their doors altogether.  Simply put: This is a public safety issue.  Ive been concerned that since the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) currently views volunteer firefighters as employees, fire companies and municipalities would be forced to provide health insurance or pay a fine, saddling them with unbearable financial burdens and threatening public safety.  I sent the IRS a letter in November requesting a clarification, but the correspondence has gone unanswered as of today.  Under the Employer Mandate Provision, employers with 50 or more employees must provide health insurance or pay penalties.  This could be problematic for fire companies, particularly in Pennsylvania where 97-percent of stations rely exclusively or mostly on volunteers.  Fire companies could exceed the 50 employee threshold in several different ways: by themselves based on their size, by being part of a larger combined force under several different chiefs, or by being part of a municipality that has 50 or more public employees in total.    Some fire companies may hear about this and immediately think, Well, weve only got 25 volunteers so were safe.  We dont have fifty. That may not necessarily be the case.  Some fire companies are considered part of their local government.  That could mean that if you take the number of firefighters  paid and unpaid  now considered employees by the IRS, and add them to the number of other public employees, you can easily reach fifty, even in a small town.', 'Admin reached deal w the man who bragged of advancing #nukes prgrm thru deception.

Why not extend it to the end of the year?   The walking was a wonderful challenge. Most days I made it 7,000 steps or more. Some days way over, while others as low as 4,000 but it has made a difference. Hardest part for me was the bed time snacks and of course the ice cream. I can't completely give it up but I can limit the amount. I found alcohol wasn't a problem though occasionally hard during a late dinner with friends. I limited it to 1 or 2 glasses of red wine and then rest of the evening drank water.   I found my weight fluctuated during the challenge. I lost some and gained back some over the past few weeks. Thankfully, overall it was a net loss. I am now going to try and lose 25 more lbs over the year.   Thank you for all the kind notes during the challenge. They really helped keep going on the first lap. Of course I want to thank Mary for inspiring me to do this challenge. Her helpful hints made us all better informed about the consequences of the food we eat. Finally, congratulations to everyone who completed the challenge.
