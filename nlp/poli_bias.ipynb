The Koch brothers and Adelson have played growing roles in bankrolling favored politicians since the Supreme Court in 2010 struck down limits on campaign spending. Because of this disastrous Supreme Court decision in Citizens United, a bad situationand its been bad for a whilehas become much worse, Sen. Bernie Sanders said in an Truthdig interview.  Sanders also talked about how big money controls Congress. Despite the fact that we have a collapsing middle class, more people living in poverty than at any time during our history, and the gap between the very, very rich and everyone else growing wider, it is very hard for me to imagine significant legislation being passed that Wall Street and the big money interests dont want, the senator told Truthdigs Alexander Reed Kelly.

', 'This morning I offered an amendment to reform the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program as part of legislation currently under consideration by the full Senate that would extend unemployment benefits. My amendment would strengthen existing requirements to ensure unemployment benefits are going to individuals actively looking for work and individuals who truly want to return to the labor force.   The amendment would prohibit individuals from receiving EUC benefits if they fail to accept any offer of suitable work (defined as work within their capabilities) or if they refuse to apply for suitable work referred to them by a state employment agency. States would have flexibility to enforce this requirement consistent with their state laws.     We need to ensure that only those who are actively seeking work but cannot find it are receiving these benefits. I have heard repeatedly from frustrated employers in Indiana who have offered jobs but are told by the applicants that they would rather keep collecting unemployment benefits until they run out. This undermines the core idea of a program designed to help those only in emergency situations who are unable to secure employment.

Unfortunately, as the HHS data notes, we can only see numbers for counties with more than 50 UACs. With such numbers (or lack thereof), how are we tracking their safety?  Rather than discouraging the dangerous journey to our southern border, the Presidents policies have continued the allusion that our country will accept everyone with open arms.

While fighting the Japanese on the island of Bataan, outnumbered and under equipped, Dyess and his comrades surrendered to the enemies on April 10, 1942, and were marched to a prisoner-of-war camp in the infamous Bataan Death March.

Bernie Sanders said Congress must narrow the scope of a law used to justify the bulk collection of Americans\\' telephone records. I voted against the Patriot Act. We\\'ve introduced legislation to curb what the NSA is doing, Sanders told MSNBC\\'s Thomas Roberts. Lawmakers supporting the vast domestic surveillance databases argue that collecting phone records and emails makes the country safer. \"Yeah it does,\" Sanders said in a report broadcast by NBC News affiliates nationwide. \"But it doesn\\'t make us a free country.\"   NSA is \\'Out of Control\\': The National Security Agency is \"out of control and operating in an unconstitutional manner,\" Sen. Sanders said, according to The Nation, ABC News Radio, Vermont Public Radio and Common Dreams. \"I will be working as hard as I can to pass the strongest legislation possible to end the abuses by the NSA and other intelligence agencies, Sanders said. A Brattleboro Reformer editorial said, Sanders is right to pursue this matter further, for one federal judges ruling certainly wont bring an end to the NSA spying controversy.  Tech Giants Air Privacy Worries at White House: President Obama met Tuesday with the nation\\'s leading technology executives who want changes of surveillance programs in the name of civil liberties, a concern that CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta said is spreading in Congress. Its not just the executives of these tech companies, not just a federal judge who says that these collections of phone records may be unconstitutional. You have lawmakers up on Capitol Hill, the entire spectrum from Bernie Sanders all the way over to Rand Paul, saying that something has to be done.   Senate Poised to Pass Budget: A bipartisan agreement to ease sharp spending cuts known as sequestration easily cleared its last major hurdle Tuesday as 67 senators voted to advance the measure. This is a very difficult vote. Its very much the lesser of two evils, Sen. Sanders, according to Real Clear Politics.  Sanders was an unenthusiastic supporter, according to CNN. \"This budget does not even begin to address some of the very serious problems facing our country in terms of creating the millions of jobs we need, in terms of doing away with these outrageous corporate loopholes right now which are costing us about $100 billion a year,\" Sanders told  Nicole Sandler on The Randi Rhodes Show.

For the first time in over three decades, Congress has the opportunity to pass a serious comprehensive immigration reform bill. It has the support of a broad coalition of leaders, including members of both parties and business, labor, and immigration advocacy groups. It goes a long way in addressing critical concerns- it creates a path to citizenship for immigrants that pay their taxes, obey our laws and learn English. It also helps reunite broken families, gives young DREAMers an opportunity to pursue their goals and directs resources towards securing our border.  El Paso will be uniquely impacted by whatever bill Congress passes and I am committed to making sure our voice is heard in this debate. Our community has long dealt with the consequences of both long wait times at our ports and immigration laws that break up families and ignore economic conditions.

Please SHARE his press release:  H.R. 3436: THE NSA INSPECTOR GENERAL ACT OF 2013   WASHINGTON, D.C.  Yesterday, Representative Mark Sanford (SC-1), along with ten Republicans (including the rest of the South Carolina Republican delegation) and two Democrats, introduced H.R. 3436, The National Security Agency Inspector General Act of 2013, in the House of Representatives:   With information continuing to drip out regarding activities at the NSA that at best raise questions about the legality of their conduct and at worst are in direct violation of the Constitution, yesterday I introduced legislation to help correct this behavior, by making the NSA Inspector General (IG) position a presidential appointment, to be confirmed by the Senate, said Sanford. This process already exists at the CIA, Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security.   Right now, the IG is appointed by the Director of the NSA, which curbs their oversight effectiveness because the Director can remove them, added Sanford. As recently noted in an op-ed by the former IG of the CIA, Britt Snider, this lack of independence creates an environment where employees of the IGs office worry about their careers if their findings and conclusions are critical of the agency.   There are a number of reforms that need to be made at the NSA to ensure the Agency is not violating the privacy of Americans, but without a robust IG office, these reforms will lack the teeth they need to be enforced. In this vein, I feel this legislation is a reasonable and necessary step that will help bring positive change to the Agency.

Griffiths #VA09 STAFF will be holding office hours tomorrow, 6/4, in Marion, Covington, New Castle, & Bristol: ', 'I talked with @MitchellReports this afternoon about President Obamas plan to confront ISIL. Watch here: ', \"As we await the President's speech tonight with regard to executive amnesty, I thought it would be useful to read a bit of what he has said in the past on the subject. Toward that end, the Speaker's office circulated the list below, and I thought you might find it of interest:  I take the Constitution very seriously. The biggest problems that were facing right now have to do with [the president] trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all. And thats what I intend to reverse when Im President of the United States of America. (3/31/08)  Weve got a government designed by the Founders so that thered be checks and balances. You dont want a president whos too powerful or a Congress thats too powerful or a court thats too powerful. Everybodys got their own role. Congresss job is to pass legislation. The president can veto it or he can sign it. _ I believe in the Constitution and I will obey the Constitution of the United States. We're not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an end-run around Congress. (5/19/08)  Comprehensive reform, that's how we're going to solve this problem. _ Anybody who tells you it's going to be easy or that I can wave a magic wand and make it happen hasn't been paying attention to how this town works. (5/5/10)  [T]here are those in the immigrants rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those who are [here] illegally with legal status, or at least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation until we have better laws. ... I believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair. It would suggest to those thinking about coming here illegally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision. And this could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration. And it would also ignore the millions of people around the world who are waiting in line to come here legally. Ultimately, our nation, like all nations, has the right and obligation to control its borders and set laws for residency and citizenship.  And no matter how decent they are, no matter their reasons, the 11 million who broke these laws should be held accountable. (7/1/10)  I do have an obligation to make sure that I am following some of the rules. I can't simply ignore laws that are out there. I've got to work to make sure that they are changed. (10/14/10)  I am president, I am not king. I can't do these things just by myself. We have a system of government that requires the Congress to work with the Executive Branch to make it happen. I'm committed to making it happen, but I've got to have some partners to do it. _ The main thing we have to do to stop deportations is to change the laws. _ [T]he most important thing that we can do is to change the law because the way the system works  again, I just want to repeat, I'm president, I'm not king. If Congress has laws on the books that says that people who are here who are not documented have to be deported, then I can exercise some flexibility in terms of where we deploy our resources, to focus on people who are really causing problems as a opposed to families who are just trying to work and support themselves. But there's a limit to the discretion that I can show because I am obliged to execute the law. That's what the Executive Branch means. I can't just make the laws up by myself. So the most important thing that we can do is focus on changing the underlying laws. (10/25/10)  America is a nation of laws, which means I, as the President, am obligated to enforce the law. I don't have a choice about that. That's part of my job. But I can advocate for changes in the law so that we have a country that is both respectful of the law but also continues to be a great nation of immigrants. _ With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, thats just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed _. [W]eve got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branchs job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws. There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as President. (3/28/11)  I can't solve this problem by myself. _ [W]e're going to have to have bipartisan support in order to make it happen. _ I can't do it by myself. We're going to have to change the laws in Congress, but I'm confident we can make it happen. (4/20/11)  I know some here wish that I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself.  But thats not how democracy works.  See, democracy is hard.  But its right. Changing our laws means doing the hard work of changing minds and changing votes, one by one. (4/29/11)  Sometimes when I talk to immigration advocates, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But thats not how a democracy works. What we really need to do is to keep up the fight to pass genuine, comprehensive reform. That is the ultimate solution to this problem. That's what Im committed to doing. (5/10/11)  I swore an oath to uphold the laws on the books _. Now, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own. Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. I promise you. Not just on immigration reform. But that's not how our system works. Thats not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written. (7/25/11)  So what weve tried to do is within the constraints of the laws on the books, weve tried to be as fair, humane, just as we can, recognizing, though, that the laws themselves need to be changed. _ The most important thing for your viewers and listeners and readers to understand is that in order to change our laws, weve got to get it through the House of Representatives, which is currently controlled by Republicans, and weve got to get 60 votes in the Senate. _ Administratively, we can't ignore the law. _ I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.  We are doing everything we can administratively.  But the fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that I have to enforce.  And I think theres been a great disservice done to the cause of getting the DREAM Act passed and getting comprehensive immigration passed by perpetrating the notion that somehow, by myself, I can go and do these things.  Its just not true. _ We live in a democracy.  You have to pass bills through the legislature, and then I can sign it.  And if all the attention is focused away from the legislative process, then that is going to lead to a constant dead-end. We have to recognize how the system works, and then apply pressure to those places where votes can be gotten and, ultimately, we can get this thing solved. (9/28/11)  In June 2012, President Obama unilaterally granted deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA), allowing eligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety _ to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization. He then argued that he had already done everything he could legally do on his own:  Now, what Ive always said is, as the head of the executive branch, theres a limit to what I can do. Part of the reason that deportations went up was Congress put a whole lot of money into it, and when you have a lot of resources and a lot more agents involved, then there are going to be higher numbers. What weve said is, lets make sure that youre not misdirecting those resources. But were still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally. And thats why this continues to be a top priority of mine. _ And we will continue to make sure that how we enforce is done as fairly and justly as possible. But until we have a law in place that provides a pathway for legalization and/or citizenship for the folks in question, were going to continue to be bound by the law. _ And so part of the challenge as President is constantly saying, what authorities do I have? (9/20/12)  We are a nation of immigrants. _ But we're also a nation of laws. So what I've said is, we need to fix a broken immigration system. And I've done everything that I can on my own[.] (10/16/12)  I'm not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I'm required to follow the law. And that's what we've done. But what I've also said is, let's make sure that we're applying the law in a way that takes into account people's humanity. That's the reason that we moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law we said, we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law. (1/30/13)  Im not a king. You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law.  And, you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws, weve got some discretion. We can prioritize what we do. But we cant simply ignore the law. When it comes to the dreamers, we were able to identify that group and say, These folks are generally not a risk. Theyre not involved in crime. _ And so lets prioritize our enforcement resources. But to sort through all the possible cases of everybody who might have a sympathetic story to tell is very difficult to do. This is why we need comprehensive immigration reform. To make sure that once and for all, in a way that is, you know, ratified by Congress, we can say that there is a pathway to citizenship for people who are staying out of trouble, who are trying to do the right thing, whove put down roots here. _ My job is to carry out the law. And so Congress gives us a whole bunch of resources. They give us an order that weve got to go out there and enforce the laws that are on the books.  _ If this was an issue that I could do unilaterally I would have done it a long time ago. _ The way our system works is Congress has to pass legislation. I then get an opportunity to sign it and implement it. (1/30/13)  This is something Ive struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that Im the president of the United States, Im not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed. And Congress right now has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system. And what that means is that we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place even if we think that in many cases the results may be tragic. (2/14/13)  I think that it is very important for us to recognize that the way to solve this problem has to be legislative. I can do some things and have done some things that make a difference in the lives of people by determining how our enforcement should focus. _ And weve been able to provide help through deferred action for young people _. But this is a problem that needs to be fixed legislatively. (7/16/13)  My job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed. Congress has said here is the law when it comes to those who are undocumented, and they've allocated a whole bunch of money for enforcement. And, what I have been able to do is to make a legal argument that I think is absolutely right, which is that given the resources that we have, we can't do everything that Congress has asked us to do. What we can do is then carve out the DREAM Act folks, saying young people who have basically grown up here are Americans that we should welcome. _ But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option. _ What I've said is there is a there's a path to get this done, and that's through Congress. (9/17/13)  [I]f, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But were also a nation of laws. Thats part of our tradition. And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what Im proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. _ It is not simply a matter of us just saying were going to violate the law. Thats not our tradition. The great thing about this country is we have this wonderful process of democracy, and sometimes it is messy, and sometimes it is hard, but ultimately, justice and truth win out. (11/25/13)  I am the Champion-in-Chief of comprehensive immigration reform. But what Ive said in the past remains true, which is until Congress passes a new law, then I am constrained in terms of what I am able to do. What Ive done is to use my prosecutorial discretion, because you cant enforce the laws across the board for 11 or 12 million people, there arent the resources there.  What weve said is focus on folks who are engaged in criminal activity, focus on people who are engaged in gang activity. Do not focus on young people, who were calling DREAMers _. That already stretched my administrative capacity very far. But I was confident that that was the right thing to do. But at a certain point the reason that these deportations are taking place is, Congress said, you have to enforce these laws. They fund the hiring of officials at the department thats charged with enforcing.  And I cannot ignore those laws any more than I could ignore, you know, any of the other laws that are on the books. Thats why its so important for us to get comprehensive immigration reform done this year. (3/6/14)  I think that I never have a green light [to push the limits of executive power].  Im bound by the Constitution; Im bound by separation of powers.  There are some things we cant do. Congress has the power of the purse, for example. _ Congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending. So I dont have a green light. _ My preference in all these instances is to work with Congress, because not only can Congress do more, but its going to be longer-lasting.
